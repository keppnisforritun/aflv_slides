	\begin{frame}[plain]{Flow problems}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item What is maximum flow?
			\item We imagine each edge in a (directed) graph is a pipe, and the weight says how many units of liquid can pass through it per second.
			\item Then vertices are joints, and the amount of liquid going in and out must be the same.
			\item Except for one vertex where we let water flow in from the outside, the source, and one where we let it flow out, the sink.
			\item Then the maximum flow problem is the problem of determining the maximum amount of liquid that can flow per second from the source to the sink.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}[plain]{Formal definition}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item For a graph $G = (V, E)$ we say that $f : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a flow from $s \in V$ to $t \in V$ if $0 \leq f(e) \leq c_e$ where $c_e$ is the capacity for $e$ and for all $v \in V \setminus{s, t}$ we have
			\[\sum_{e \in \text{out}(v)} f(e) = \sum_{e \in \text{in}(v)} f(e)\]
			\item The value of a flow $f$ is the amount of liquid flowing out at the source (or in at the sink, equivalently), more formally given as
			\[\sum_{e \in \text{out}(s)} f(e) = \sum_{e \in \text{in}(t)} f(e)\]
			\item The maximum flow problem is then to find the flow with the maximum value for a given graph.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}[plain]{First solution ideas}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item How do we solve this?
			\item Brute force trying every combination will be massively slow.
			\item So we just try something greedy.
			\item<2-> How about we just find some path from $s$ to $t$ where we can fit more flow, and fit more flow there?
			\item<2-> Rinse and repeat, until we get stuck.
		\end{itemize}

	\begin{frame}[plain]{Max-flow Min-cut}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The fact that the min cut has value $23$ as well is no coincidence.
			\item It is not too hard to see that a max flow can never exceed a cut, as the flow has to pass from one side to the other of the cut using only the edges in the cut.
			\item So all cuts have costs greater or equal to the values of all flows.
			\item So if we find a flow that has value equal to the cost of a cut, that flow must be maximal and that cut minimal.
			\item The fact is, this is always the case. The maximum flow value is always equal to the cost of the minimum cut, proved by Ford and Fulkerson in 1962.

	\begin{frame}[plain]{Max-flow Min-cut}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The proof is not so hard, it is just a proof by looking at the greedy algorithm above and showing that if the flow is not yet equal to the cost of a minimum cut there must be some path that gets us closer.
			\item The proof also gives us that our greedy method always gets us closer to the answer in each step.
			\item But our algorithm is missing something to get all the way there!

			\item<2-> So we have $\mathcal{O}(V + E)$ but the flow might just increase by one each time.
			\item<2-> Therefore the complexity is $\mathcal{O}(F(V + E))$ where $F$ is the maximum flow.

			\item The problem is that if the capacities are very large, this is quite slow (in the worst case).
			\item There are ways around this, we just have to be more specific about how we find our augmenting paths.
			\item We essentially have two options, DFS and BFS:
			\item If you try both, you will see that BFS gives better worst-case behaviour.

	\begin{frame}[plain]{Edmond Karp}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Ford-Fulkerson with BFS is known as Edmond-Karp.
			\item The key feature one can prove is that if you saturate an edge several in the process, it must always be further away from the source along the augmenting path than last time. (Proof by contradiction, bit tricky, but not terrible)
			\item Then each edge can be saturated at most $V$ times, so we do at most $VE$ augmentations.
			\item Thus the time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(VE^2)$ at most (still also at most $\mathcal{O}(FE)$)

		\begin{itemize}
			\item There are many practical situations where we want to pair up some set of objects with another, but not every pair is acceptable, and each objects can only be in one pair.
			\item As an example my team solved a problem for a contest of practical problems hosted by Google (Hash Code) about pairing employees to tasks they can handle using a variant of this method.
			\item We can use maximum flow just by making the graph on the last slide (except with 1 instead of $\infty$ so each vertex can only be in ine pair) and putting an edge with capacity $1$ between any two vertices we are allowed to pair together.

			\item This is an assignment problem of games to winners, so we can model it with maximum flow.
			\item Each game (or rather pairing of teams) gets a node which can flow to winners, and the winners have a limit of flow to the sink based on how many wins would put them ahead of $x$.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Some theorems also give us use cases for maximum flow. König's theorem for example gives us the solution to the minimum vertex cover (fewest vertices needed to touch every edge) problem in bipartite graphs in terms of the maximum matching. 
			\item Menger's theorem tells us that the number of disjoint paths between $s$ and $t$ in a graph is equal to the maximum flow from $s$ to $t$ if every edge has unit capacity. This way we can find whether a graph is $k$-edge-connected. (There is also a version of Menger's theorem for vertex connectivity)

	\begin{frame}[plain]{Tricks}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Aside from there being many theorems that show that max flow or problems solved solved by max flow are equivalent to something else, there are also many constructions that allow us to solve more general problems.
			\item We already saw how to have multiple sources and sinks, but let's look at some other examples of this.
			\item We'll look at vertex capacities and flows with demands as two examples.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Say we have a flow problem, but we want to limit the amount of flow that goes through each vertex as well
			\item We can split the vertex, and make it have an internal edge with a capacity
			\item So each edge pointing to $v$ goes to a new vertex $v_{\text{in}}$, each pointing out goes from a new vertex $v_{\text{out}}$, and then we put an edge from $v_{\text{in}}$ to $v_{\text{out}}$ with our desired capacity

	\begin{frame}[plain]{With demands}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item What if we want each edge $e$ to have a minimum flow $d_e$? We can ask for any flow or even the minimum flow
			\item We can actually augment the graph to solve this with maximum flow as well
			\item This won't be in the homework, but is a good exercise for those wanting to try it

	\begin{frame}[plain]{Capacity scaling}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Another trick one can use to do max flow is to start with only capacities 0/1 and solve that in $\mathcal{O}(FE) = \mathcal{O}(E)$
			\item Then we double all the capacities and flows that should be $\geq 2$ and solve again, each edge needs to be incremented at most once,
			 so this takes $\mathcal{O}(E^2)$
			 \item Then we double, and repeat
			 \item This trick is known as capacity scaling, which solves max flow in $\mathcal{O}(E^2 \log(F))$

	\begin{frame}[plain]{Dinic's algorithm}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item We need two concepts. 
			\item A blocking flow is a flow such that every path from the sink to the source has at least one saturated edge (note this is not necessarily a maximal flow).
			\item A layered network of a graph $G$ is a graph constructed in the following manner:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Let $L(v)$ be the length of the shortest (unweighted) path from the source to $v$ using only edges with capacity left.
				\item Construct a subgraph of $G$ keeping only the edges $u \rightarrow v$ such that $L(v) = L(u) + 1$.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}[plain]{Dinic's algorithm}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The algorithm proceeds by repeatedly constructing the layered network of our graph.
			\item Each time we find a blocking flow in that layered network and add it to our total flow.
			\item If we get no flow in the layered network we terminate.
			\item If we found no flow, then the layered network has no unsaturated path from $s$ to $t$ and then $G$ doesn't either, so the flow is already maximum.

	\begin{frame}[plain]{Dinic's algorithm}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Why do this?
			\item Well, now in the layered network every edge out of a vertex $v$ is "toward the sink", so pushing along any one of them is good.
			\item So when pushing flow out of $v$ we just push to the first non-saturated edge. 
			\item Each vertex is given a counter which points to the first non-saturated edge, so we just push to that edge until it's full, then increment if it's full. 
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}[plain]{Dinic's algorithm}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item How long does making a blocking flow take then?
			\item Each DFS is $\mathcal{O}(n + V))$ where $n$ is the number of increments. 
			\item Each DFS saturates one edge, so we do at most $E$ of them. And we can only increment each vertex $E$ times so the sum of all the $n$ is at most $VE$.
			\item Thus the total time is $\mathcal{O}(VE)$.
			\item Then one can prove this has to be done at most $V$ times as $L(t)$ increases each time (slightly technical, we omit it here)
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}[plain]{Dinic's algorithm}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Thus the total time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(V^2E)$, an improvement over $\mathcal{O}(VE^2)$.
			\item But I promised $\mathcal{O}(E\sqrt{V})$?
			\item Well, if all capacities are $1$ then each layered network will take $\mathcal{O}(E)$ since each edge is only considered once.
			\item One can also prove that if all capacities are $1$ there are at most $\sqrt{E}$ phases.
			\item If each vertex has either only 1 in-edge or only 1-out edge, then this can be improved to at most $\sqrt{V}$ phases.
